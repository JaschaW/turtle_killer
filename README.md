# turtle_killer

This is a helper script to try and delete every possible related items to the Turtle Plugin.

The Turtle Plugin is a virus for most pipelines, and I am sure that most studios and pipelines have their own ways to address the issue, so here is my own that I use if I ever come across this annoying plugin.

To run it, simple call:
```python
kill_the_turtle()
```

Optionially, you can call individual functions:

Example, if you only wanted to delete the turtle shelf:
```python
delete_turtle_maya_shelve()
```
